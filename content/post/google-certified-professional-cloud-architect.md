Today I passed my exam to become **Google Certified Professional Cloud
Architect**! Glad that's out the way, and I can now focus on building
the practice at Neudesic.

### Update: May 18 2017

Now I have the certificate to embed. Fair warning, this thing sets so
many cookies and trackers that it doesn't work
with [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) enabled, and
is definitely an exception to my [minimal tracking stance]({{< ref "post/minimal-tracking" >}}).
