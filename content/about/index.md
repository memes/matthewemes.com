I'm Cloud Architect with over 25 years of IT, development and
operations experience. I like to create new things from an idea and
see them through to completion.

I recently
started [Sarum Technologies Inc](https://sarumtechnologies.com/) as a
consultant on public cloud migration and application development. I
focus on delivering solutions for AWS, GCP and Azure, and am involved
in the full life-cycle of development and deployment, through to
optimisation and monitoring.

I am a father of two teenage boys, and I live in Orange County, CA
with my beautiful wife. I cannot determine which of these facts is the
most preposterous to me.

If you *think* you know what this is, cool. If you **know** what this
is, and want to verify then we can arrange a meeting. Any other keys
that match my name are either hopelessly out of date, or lost to
failed disks drives.

I am on [keybase](https://keybase.io/) too and I still have
some invites available. Hit me up at https://keybase.io/memes if you
would like an invite.
