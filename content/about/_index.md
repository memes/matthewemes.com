I'm Cloud Architect with over 25 years of IT, development and
operations experience. I like to create new things from an idea and
see them through to completion.

I am employed by [Neudesic](https://www.neudesic.com/) as *Director,
Google Platform* where I am driving the use of Google Cloud for our
clients, and for internal uses. In case it is not obvious, this is a
personal website, and it does not represent the intentions, plans or
strategies of my employer. All posts are my personal opinion, etc, etc.

I am a father of two teenage boys, and I live in Orange County, CA
with my beautiful wife. I cannot determine which of these facts is the
most preposterous to me.

If you *think* you know what this is, cool. If you **know** what this
is, and want to verify then we can arrange a meeting. Any other keys
that match my name are either hopelessly out of date, or lost to
failed disks drives.

I am on [keybase](https://keybase.io/) too and I still have
some invites available. Hit me up at https://keybase.io/memes if you
would like an invite.
