<!-- spell-checker: ignore freenode kubernetes keybase -->

I'm a Cloud Architect with over 25 years of IT, development and
operations experience. I like to create new things from an initial
idea and see them through to completion, and generally being on the
bleeding edge of technology. This is probably why I agreed
to host the [GDG Cloud OC](https://gdgcloudoc.com/) meetup on a monthly basis.

I am employed by [F5](https://www.f5.com/) as a *Global Solutions Architect* with
a focus on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and [cloud-native](https://cncf.io/)
technologies. In case it is not obvious, this is a personal website, and it does
not represent the intentions, plans or strategies of my employer. All posts are
my personal opinion, etc, etc.

## Contact

You can often find me lurking in a number of Slack communities
([Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.slack.com),
[Gophers](https://gophers.slack.completion), and [Google Cloud
Platform Community](https://googlecloud-community.slack.com)) usually with the
name *memes*.

My GnuPG public key can be downloaded [here](757446333D3EC29A.txt), or you can pull it
from a keyserver. My details are still on [keybase](https://keybase.io/) but I am
no longer actively using the service; I recommend [keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org)
as an alternative.
