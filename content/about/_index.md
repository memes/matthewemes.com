+++

I'm a Cloud Architect with over 25 years of IT, development and
operations experience. I like to create new things from an initial
idea and see them through to completion, and generally being on the
bleeding edge of technology. This is probably why I agreed
to host the [Orange County Google Cloud
Platform](https://meetup.com/oc-gcp/) meetup on a monthly basis.

I am employed by [Neudesic](https://www.neudesic.com/) as *Director,
Google Platform* where I am driving the use of Google Cloud for our
clients, and for internal uses. In case it is not obvious, this is a
personal website, and it does not represent the intentions, plans or
strategies of my employer. All posts are my personal opinion, etc, etc.

## Contact

You can often find me lurking on
[Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/) under the nick *memes*. If
IRC is too retro for your tastes, I'm in a number of Slack communities
([Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.slack.com),
[Gophers](https://gophers.slack.completion), and [Google Cloud
Platform Community](https://googlecloud-community.slack.com)) also
with the name *memes*.
